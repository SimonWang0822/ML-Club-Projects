Welcome to the RST ML Club's project repository! Here you'll find hands-on implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms built from scratch by our students.

## Project Philosophy
Our club believes in learning by building. Every project is:
  - From Scratch: No high-level libraries â€” we implement everything ourselves
  - Educational: Clear comments and documentation explaining the math
  - Hands-on: Students train models on real datasets and see results
  - Collaborative: Team-based learning with peer code reviews
